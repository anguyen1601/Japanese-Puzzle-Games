# Japanese-Puzzle-Games

This Program utilizes a game interface to implement 3 types of japanese traditional constraint puzzle games using Graphic User Interface (GUI). Each game utilizes a grid of JButtons. The user is able to solve the game on their own and check if their solution is correct. If the user gives up, they can solve the game by a solver button.
